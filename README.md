# image_caption
It is a Image Captioning bot trained on flickr8K image dataset. which generates the best possible caption for a image describing it. The model is trained on 2 neural networks, a ANN for training the images and a RNN for training the captions, and then joined by using the decoders. The 'glove.6B.50d' tokenizer was used for embedding the words. The model is made using the Keras api and trained using the Tensorflow Backend.
